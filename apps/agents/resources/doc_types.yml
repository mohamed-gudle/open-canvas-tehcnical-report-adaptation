      # FPIC / LSC Documentation Template

      ## Stakeholder Mapping

      **Objective:** Identify all Indigenous Peoples, local communities, and stakeholders impacted or interested in the project.

      **Instructions:**
      - Map affected parties (e.g., villages, landowners, user groups).
      - Note vulnerable subgroups (women, youth, elders).
      - List formal and customary decision-making structures.

      **Example Table:**

      | Stakeholder Group | Type | Proximity | Vulnerabilities | Representation |
      |-------------------|------|-----------|------------------|----------------|
      | Village A         | Indigenous | Adjacent to site | Elderly/Youth | Council of Elders |
      | Women's Group B   | Community Org | Within 5 km | Limited access to formal meetings | Chairwoman + 2 reps |

      ## Legal & Policy Framework

      **Objective:** Define the legal and voluntary standards governing the consultation process.

      **Instructions:**
      - List national FPIC laws or Indigenous rights provisions.
      - Reference international frameworks (UNDRIP, ILO 169, IFC PS7).
      - Include any voluntary commitments (RSPO, FSC, ICMM, etc.).

      **Example:**
      - UNDRIP Article 32.2 - Obligation to obtain FPIC before approval of projects.
      - ILO 169 Article 6 - Obligation to consult in good faith.
      - Kenya Constitution (Article 63) - Recognition of community land rights.

      ## Engagement Protocols

      **Objective:** Describe how engagement will be conducted.

      **Instructions:**
      - Use culturally appropriate communication and meeting methods.
      - Ensure inclusion of women, youth, and persons with disabilities.
      - Define timing, language, and format for consultations.

      **Checklist:**
      - [ ] Local language translations provided
      - [ ] Female facilitators for women-only groups
      - [ ] Written and oral options for low-literacy stakeholders

      ## FPIC Process Steps

      **Objective:** Document each step of the Free, Prior, and Informed Consent process.

      ### Step 1: Pre-Consultation
      - Agree on process design with community leaders.
      - Define how consent will be given (e.g., public resolution, elders' vote).

      ### Step 2: Information Disclosure
      - Provide project details, risks, ESIA summaries in accessible formats.
      - Allow for time to review independently.

      ### Step 3: Community Consultation
      - Hold inclusive and repeated meetings.
      - Allow time for internal deliberation without external pressure.

      ### Step 4: Consent Outcome
      - Record the final decision:
        - Consent given (mark Yes), withheld (mark No), or conditional (note conditions)
      - Attach meeting minutes, signed statements, or declarations.

      ## Local Stakeholder Consultation (LSC)

      **Objective:** Capture broader community engagement beyond Indigenous groups.

      **Instructions:**
      - List meetings held, participants, and issues raised.
      - Highlight changes to project design based on feedback.

      **Table Example:**

      | Date | Location | Stakeholders | Key Issues Raised | Outcome |
